            <h2>The Start Of My Journey</h2>
            <h5>Posted on March 10, 2021</h5><br>
            <p>Welcome to the first ever blogpost. You’re here at the ground level, meaning you’re either a really good friend, or an absolute weirdo; either way, welcome!</p><br>
            <p>The idea behind Brewskies to Barrels is to teach young people about fine spirits, because there is a whole world you’re overlooking when you’re crushing white claws 
                and doing keg stands. The idea for this blog is in the name: I want to evolve our generation from the “brewskie” crushing youth that we are, to the finer, whisky 
                drinking connoisseurs we have the potential to be.</p><br>
            <p>The idea I have for this blog is to simply talk about high-end liquors, which have become one of my interests in the past couple years (don’t judge, quarantine’s been rough). 
               I will focus mostly on whisk(e)y (bet you didn’t know there are multiple ways of spelling it), but will diverge into different alcoholic beverages. The first few posts will 
               be quite surface level, as I think most people reading this have minimal knowledge related to high end liquor. My goal is to provide basic knowledge to people my age so that 
               the next time you go out to a fancy dinner, you’re able to show that you know what you’re talking about (trust me, even the dumbest terms can impress people). 
            </p><br>
            <p>I think this blog will serve as a good starting point for your journey, I hope that you enjoy what I write!</p><br>
