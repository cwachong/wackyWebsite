                to be tried, and what can be skipped out on completely.

            <ul>
                <li>0: Horrible, worst thing I've ever drank</li>
                <li>1: If I was already drunk, I MIGHT think about drinking this</li>    
                <li>2: Might be okay if drowned with soda or juice</li>    
                <li>3: Still not great neat, but with some ice or chase its drinkable</li>    
                <li>4: If given neat could drink it, but worse than the average (higher end) scotch</li>     
                <li>5: The mean, drinkable neat but nothing special</li>    
                <li>6: Above average, quite nice, but once again nothing incredible</li>     
                <li>7: Nice whisky, something I would consider buying</li>    
                <li>8: Great whisky, definitely something I would buy if available/affordable</li>    
                <li>9: Incredible whisky, one of my all time favourites, I would buy it even at secondary pricing</li>    
                <li>10: Unicorn, nothing should ever reach this level</li>

            <h3><u>Redbreast</u> 12 Year</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Colour:</b> Quite Dark for a 12 year, I'd be curious if there's colouring added. 
                The colour of apple juice from concentrate.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                <b>Nose:</b> heavy heavy sherry influence. Smelled differently in the boston round, 
                but in the glencairn I get dark fruits, raisins, figs, prunes etc. There are also 
                notes of chocolate, and some lighter fruit notes, such as older red delicious apples, 
                when they become crumbly.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                <b>Palate:</b> WOW, That is intense sherry. I get a slight difference from  scotch, 
                but this is quite unlike the cheaper Irish whiskies I've tried. There is a slight 
                ethanol bite initially, but throughout that sip you get raisins and fruit from the 
                start all the way to the end. This whisky definitely warms you up, and drinks well 
                for its ABV. Quite full mouthfeel, but the malty notes do pair very well with the sherry notes.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                <b>Finish:</b> The heavier mouthfeel does carry over, and the whisky itself finishes 
                with a decent ethanol bite. Those sherry notes stay, with the raisin notes really hitting 
                at the back of the tongue, absolutely caressing and serenading my olfactory system. Once 
                those sherry notes, it ends with a very familiar malty note, as I get when I drink scotch. 
            </p><br>
            <p>
                <b>Final:</b> Wow does this whisky drink above its price range, super full mouth feel, 
                delicious and complex sherry notes leave, and holds its weight at ABV making hold its 
                weight without being a pushover. Overall incredibly impressed, and this tempts me to 
                get into the world of irish whisky. This follows what I expected to be the archetypal 
                Irish whisky, but with a ton more sherry.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                <b>Score:</b> 6.5/10
            </p><br>
