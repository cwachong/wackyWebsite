        <h1>Welcome Wanderer, to WaChong's Wacky Website</h1>
        <p>I decided to join the pilgramage every junior dev goes on at the beggining of their career and create my own website</p><br>
        <p>I won't lie, its pretty rough right now, but soon enough Ill flesh this out and itll be very epic</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm currently a software engineer at Kardium, where we design very cool things that save peoples lives</li>
            <li>As much as I love writing in Java, I felt like it would really help to learn some web dev skills</li>
            <li>I'm a huge fan of Scotch Whisky, collection is up to 120 bottles (and counting)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This website wont look pretty, but I'm going to be using it as a place to write all my thoughts, create small webapps, and generally experiment. Maybe at some point in the future I'll learn React</p>
